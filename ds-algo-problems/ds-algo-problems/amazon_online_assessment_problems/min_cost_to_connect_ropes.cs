             * 
        Given n ropes of different lengths, we need to connect these ropes into one rope. We can connect only 2 ropes at a time. The cost required to connect 2 ropes is equal to sum of their lengths. The length of this connected rope is also equal to the sum of their lengths. This process is repeated until n ropes are connected into a single rope. Find the min possible cost required to connect all ropes.

        Example 1:

        Input: ropes = [8, 4, 6, 12]
        Output: 58
        Explanation: The optimal way to connect ropes is as follows
        1. Connect the ropes of length 4 and 6 (cost is 10). Ropes after connecting: [8, 10, 12]
        2. Connect the ropes of length 8 and 10 (cost is 18). Ropes after connecting: [18, 12]
        3. Connect the ropes of length 18 and 12 (cost is 30).
        Total cost to connect the ropes is 10 + 18 + 30 = 58
        Example 2:

        Input: ropes = [20, 4, 8, 2]
        Output: 54
        Example 3:

        Input: ropes = [1, 2, 5, 10, 35, 89]
        Output: 224
        Example 4:

        Input: ropes = [2, 2, 3, 3]
        Output: 20
